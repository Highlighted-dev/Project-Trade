# About Project-Trade
An Amazon-scraper is used to scrape the data about the products from amazon. After that it calculates daily sales based on the reviews that product recieved recently and also saves the price for price history. On the client this data is shown in a user-friendly way, and the server connects the scraper and the client together. Whats fun about this project that there are a lot of hand-crafted stuff that is usefull in other projects: own auth system, login panels, a lot of components ready to use with customizable css etc.
